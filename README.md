## CS140e, Winter 2026

We're currently accepting applications for winter 2026:
 - [https://forms.gle/4R16Q3bspV5acwAm8](https://forms.gle/4R16Q3bspV5acwAm8)

NOTE:
  - We are doing rolling acceptances, currently aiming for the first
    set of decisions a week after the quarter ends.  But we will be
    reviewing applications up until the class starts.

  - The application doesn't make this clear, but PhD students from
    other depts are definitely welcome!   Also, if you're a section lead
    please make sure to note this in the application.

The 2025 repo is [here](https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-25win) if you
want to look at the old materials.  There should be some significant
improvements this year, but tbd.
