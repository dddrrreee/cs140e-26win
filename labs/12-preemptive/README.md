By the end of this lab you'll have your own simple pre-emptive threads
package and it won't actually be that hard.  Crucially, it will *work*
to the point that we'll be surprised if your code has a bug in it.
The reason for this strong claim is that you will use the debugging
hardware to verify that running code pre-emptively gives exactly the same
results as running it sequentially --- that every register has exactly
the same value for each instruction that gets executed.  Given the pieces
you've built so far, building this "single step equivalence"  checking
won't be hard and yet will make hard things easy because it makes them
trivial to completely check against a simple reference.

Readings:
  - Make sure you look at the [PRELAB.md](PRELAB.md).
  - And the example in [0-srs-rfe-example](0-srs-rfe-example/README.md).

Next week you'll be able to combine this threading system with the 
virtual memory you build to make user level processes that can implement
the UNIX system calls `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`, `waitpid()` etc.
You'll also use your single-step equivalence code to validate that this
combination works by using it compute the equivalence hash of processes
running without virtual memory and pre-emption and verifying you get
the same hash result when running with virtual memory, pre-emption.

  - NOTE: this trend of comparing the equivalence hash of code run
    in the simplest way possible to code running with full complexity
    will be a common one for the rest of the quarter and is the only way
    we know to have 80 people build their own OS and make it surprising
    if the code is broken.

    With that said, equivalence checking isn't verification, but it does
    validate so thoroughly that it's interesting to the staff if your
    code is broken but can pass equivalence checking.  (You should let
    us know if this ever occurs!)

The specific code you'll write:
  - Your own low-level pre-emptive context switching and exception
    trampoline code that will replace ours from the last couple of 
    labs (`full-except-asm.o` and `staff-switchto-asm.o`).
  - The equivalent hashing code.
Both of these will be fairly short.  The payoff at the end is a simple
pre-emptive thread package that works.

Checkoff:
  1. `make check` passes in `1-code` with all tests.
  2. `make check` passes in `2-code` with all tests.
  3. Run the autograder. Make sure you have written and pushed 
     your own part 3 `3-tests` too

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Background: pre-emption and context switching.

Today you'll implement the code needed to support pre-emption.
Pre-emption refers to forcibly interrupting a computation (for example
using a timer-interrupt or debug exception).

The threads package you wrote in lab 5 was non-preemptive ("cooperative")
in that threads ran until they yielded the processor (e.g., by calling
`rpi_yield()` or `rpi_exit()`).  Cooperative threading has two big
positives:
  1. It is relatively simple to build: just save and restore the 
     callee-saved registers.
  2. It is relatively simple to use: by default, the code being run by a
     given thread is a non-interruptible, "critical section" that
     can't be interrupted by another thread that pre-empts it.  Thus,
     you can view cooperatively threaded code as being made of large
     atomic sections only broken up by voluntary yields.

Unfortunately, we can't generally rely on user processes to run 
cooperatively:
  1. Even one infinite loop would lock up the system.  We need some way
     to bound how long the user process can run before the kernel gets
     back control.
  2. Devices won't generally work well.   Many devices have small
     queues (e.g., UART) or tight timing requirements (for correctness
     or speed).  If the kernel can only check a device when the user
     yields then at best throughput and latency will suck and at worse
     it would lose data and gain bugs.

Thus, we want to two things:
  1. To be able to run user-processes pre-emptively where they can be
     forcibly interrupted (e.g., by a timer-interrupt, device interrupt
     or debug hardware exceptions).

  2. When we interrupt a process we want to *completely* save its state
     --- all 16 general purpose registers and CPSR --- so we can switch
     to another process by loading its state --- also, all 16 general
     purpose registers and CPSR.

You've already done many labs where you've interrupted running code
(step 1).  The only new thing for this lab is saving and restoring
*all* registers (callee and caller, as well as the CPSR) rather than
just saving:

  - Only the caller-saved registers, as we did for interrupts
    where we returned back to exactly the code that got interrupted
    rather than switching to another thread or process after the interrupt
    was done.

    (Recall: we saved caller registers before calling the C interrupt
    handler because the compiler would assume it could trash any caller
    register and we don't know which ones were in use.  We didn't have
    to save the callee-saved because the C compiler would do so before
    using them.)

  - Only the callee-saved registers, as we did for cooperative threads
    where because the thread code called the yielding routine itself the
    C compiler would know the caller-saved registers were potentially
    trashed so would save and restore them itself. (Useful question:
    Why did we need to save callee since the C code would?)

You've already saved and restored registers before in isolation so
conceptually its not hard to save both.  However, the ARM has the
complication that:

  1. It has different "modes" for user level, kernel level and
     different exceptions.  Each of mode has private copies of some
     registers (for today: sp and lr).  These are called "banked"
     registers or shadow registers.   

  2. When an exception occurs we will be at a different
     mode than the code that got interrupted.

Thus, you'll have to write code to read and write the registers at one
level from another --- for the most part, the unprivileged user stack
pointer (sp) and return register (lr) from a privileged interrupt context.

## Part 0: Reading and writing user registers 


This lab depends on correctly figuring out low-level machine facts: how
to change modes, how to access registers in one mode from another, etc.
So we'll first do these parts in isolated, easy to debug pieces.

As we mentioned above, in order to save and restore the state of a level
process from privileged mode we'll have read and write the two banked
user-mode registers (`sp` and `lr`).  The set of tests have you implement
the code to read and write these registers in three different ways.

The code you write:
  - `0-user-sp-lr-asm.S`: contains all the code to write. 


There are four test harnesses.  You don't have to modify them though you
should definitely insert assertions or print statements if things act
weirdly!  Look at the comments in the files and the tests and implement
each part at a time.  This is a pretty mechanical fetch quest.

You should do them in the following order:

  1. `0-cps-user-sp-lr.c`: get the USER SP and LR registers
     by using the `cps` instruction to switch to `SYS_MODE` (which has the
     same registers as USER) and back.  The `0-user-sp-lr-asm.S` file has
     a example for `cps_user_sp_get` but you should fill in the others.

```
        @ 0-user-sp-lr-asm.S: get USER mode's sp and return the 
        @ result in r0.
        MK_FN(cps_user_sp_get)
            cps #SYS_MODE
            prefetch_flush(r1);   @ note we have to use a caller reg
        
            @ USER And SYSTEM share the same sp/lr/cpsr
            mov r0, sp
        
            cps #SUPER_MODE
            prefetch_flush(r1);
        
            bx lr

```

  2. `0-mem-user-sp-lr.c`: do the same as (1) but use the `ldm` and
      `stm` instructions with the carat operator "^" to access the
      user registers.  The routine `mem_user_sp_get` has an example:

```
        @ store the user mode sp into the address passed as the 
        @ first parameter (i.e., in r0)
        MK_FN(mem_user_sp_get)
            @ store the user mode <sp> register into memory
            @ pointed to by <r0>
            stm r0, {sp}^
            bx lr
```

     If you get confused about the semantics don't forget to look closely
     at the test!  (True for all the other parts, too.)


  3. `0-any-mode-sp-lr.c` generalize the mode switching method for
     any mode (other than USER) so that you can read and write registers
     at any privileged mode.

     You should use the `msr` instruction with the `_c` modifier to to set
     the `cpsr` mode using a register:

            msr cpsr_c, r0


     Followed by a prefetch_flush that uses a caller saved register you
     don't care about.  You can see an example of where we use `msr` in
     `libpi/staff-start.S`


Great: you now are able to (1) read and write banked registers of other
modes (both privileged and user-level) and (2) switch between privileged
modes.  We'll now setup the code to switch to user mode.

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Part 1: using `rfe` to switch to user level

Here you'll implement different examples that use the `rfe` instruction.
The `rfe` instruction lets you simultaneously set both the `pc` and `cpsr`
at once and is a key part of how you context switch into a user process.

Unlike your thread context-switch code you can't switch into a user-level
process by simply setting the `pc` register because you *also* have to
change the `cpsr` to switch from privileged kernel mode to unprivileged
`USER` mode.  If you did this mode switch before jumping to user code
you'd get a privileged fault (since the `pc` would still be in kernel
memory).  And doing it after has similar issues. The `rfe` instruction
lets you set both at once.

To see how `rfe` works:
  1. RTFM the manual.
  2. Then look at the complete example `1-rfe-example.c`, with associated
     assembly code in: `1-rfe-asm.S:rfe_asm` and
     `1-rfe-asm.S:rfe_trampoline_asm`.  Make sure the comments and output
     make sense or the next 6 lines of code could easily take a few hours.

There are two tests.  Since messing up assembly can be hard to debug,
we split restoring registers into one small change (test 1), and then
a larger one (test 2):

 1. `1-rfe-blk.c`.  This changes the example we give you
    `1-rfe-example.c` in a minor way to take a 17-entry array of
    32-bit words (as you would use with process switching) instead of
    a 2-entry one.

    What to do: You should write the code `1-rfe-asm.S:blk_rfe_asm`
    to handle a 17-entry array with the PC at word offset 15 (byte
    offset 15x4), and the CPSR you want to restore at word offset 16
    (byte offset 16x4).  This differs from our example where the pc
    was at offset 0 and cpsr was at word offset 1 (so byte offset 4).
    All you have to do is add the right constant value to the sp register
    before doing the rfe instruction.

    (NOTE: It's a trivial change, but you want this correct before doing
    the next step.)

 2. `1-rfe-switchto-user.c`: This step sets all the registers in the
    17-entry array and eliminates the need for a trampoline used in
    `1-rfe-asm.S` to setup the stack pointer.

    What to do: You'll write `1-rfe-asm.S:switch_to_user_asm` to do an
    `ldm` to load user mode registers `r0-r14` and then do an `rfe`
    to load r15 and the CPSR.  This is just a matter of copying and
    modifying some of your part 1 assembly.

    ***Note, the test in its current form only validates `r0-r3`, `sp`,
    `pc` and mode (we will do the others below).***

At this point you have a partially validated register switch: we'll
do the rest of it in the next few stages.
