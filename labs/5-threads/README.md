## Writing a non-preemptive threads package



Big picture:  by the end of this lab you will have a very simple
round-robin threading package for "cooperative" (i.e., non-preemptive)
threads.

***MAKE SURE YOU***:
  - Read the [PRELAB](PRELAB.md).
  - Read the [THREAD](THREAD.md) writeup.

The main operations (see `code-thread/rpi-thread.[ch]`):
  1. `rpi_fork(code, arg)`: to create a new thread, put it on the `runq`.
  2. `rpi_yield()`: yield control to another thread.
  3. `rpi_exit(int)`: kills the current thread.
  4. `rpi_thread_start()`: starts the threading system for the first time.
      Returns when there are threads left to run.

Generally, at a minimum, each thread has its own stack --- which has
to be "large enough" so that it doesn't get overrun --- and the thread
package has to provide an assembly routine to "context switch" from one
thread to another.  Context switching works by:

   1. Saving all callee-registers from the first thread onto its stack
      and storing this new stack pointer in the thread control block.
   2. Loading all callee registers for the second from where they
      were saved.
   3. Changing the program counter value to resume the new thread.

The main magic you'll do today is writing this context-switching code and
performing the "brain-surgery" on each newly thread stack so that the
first context switch into it works.  Context-switching doesn't require
much work --- about five instructions using special ARM instructions,
but mistakes can be extremely hard to find.  So we'll break it down into
several smaller pieces.

#### Hints 

While today is exciting, a major sad is that a single bug can lead to
your code jumping off into hyperspace.  As you learned in the interrupt
lab, such bugs are hard to debug.  So before you write a bunch of code:
  - Try to make it into small, simple, testable pieces.
  - Add `assert` checks for your thread operations.
    Print all sorts of stuff so you can sanity check!  Especially the
    value of the stack pointer, the value of the register you just
    loaded.  Don't be afraid to call C code from assembly to do so.
  - When an `assert`, `demand` or `panic` happens, it will give
    the file and line number that the problem happened: look at it!
  - Use redzones to catch some memory corruption, especially a write
    to a null pointer.  See: `code-threads/0-test-redzone.c` and 
    `libpi/include/redzone.h`.
  - Make sure you look at the source for each test!  It doesn't
    make sense to blindly debug without understanding what a test does.
  - Don't treat the tests as inert objects: if one is failing,
    feel free to add print statements, asserts, check values.
    None of these will change the TRACE statements (which don't use
    line numbers).

#### Before you start: make sure everything works.

Run `make checkoff` in the `code-threads/` directory: it should pass.
1. By default the `code-threads/Makefile` will use our staff code.
   You can flip back and forth to test.
2. If you run `make checkoff` in `code-threads` all the tests should pass.
3. Before you start implementing, switch `Makefile:COMMON_SRC` to use
    your two files `rpi-threads.c` and `rpi-asm-threads.S` and not use
    ours.  
4. When you switch to use your code the tests should fail initially.

#### Checkoff:

   - You pass `make checkoff` in the `code-threads/` directory.
   - Various extensions are in: [EXTENSIONS](./EXTENSIONS.md)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Cheat sheet for common confusions:

#### What to do when a test fails.

Recall from past labs (and for future labs):

  - `make run` will just run the tests but not do checking.  Generally
    this method makes debugging crashes much easier since you can 
    see the full, linear output.

  - `make check` runs each test case specified by the `Makefile`, 
    saves the output marked with `TRACE` to a `.test` file, 
    and compares it to a reference `.out` file.

    So `0-test.c` will produce a `0-test.test` file that gets compared
    to `0-test.out`.  If it fails, you should look at the differences
    to see why.

#### Clarifications

In general:

  - Whenever you switch threads, set `rpi-thread.c:cur_thread`
    to the thread you're switching to.

  - IF YOU GET A REDZONE ERROR: this means you are corrupting
    one or more bytes in the first 4096 bytes of the pi memory (presumably
    writing to a null pointer).  So fix this.  You can add more redzone
    checks to narrow down.  See `0-test-redzone.c` for an example.   This is
    one of many different low level hacks for tring to find memory corruption.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 0: writing code to check machine understanding: `code-asm-checks`


NOTE: 
  - `code-asm-checks`: there are no .out files: you have to figure
     out if the answer is right.  You'd have to figure all of these
     out to write your threads package, so it's good to do it in 
     isolation.

This lab depends on correctly figuring out low-level machine facts.
Does the stack grow up or down?  Does a `push` instruction modify
the stack pointer before it pushes a register or after?

The ARMv6 manual does contain these facts.  However, it's easy to
misunderstand the prose, forget the right answer, just make a mistake.
In this first part of the lab you'll write small pieces of code that can
check your understanding by deriving these facts from machine behavior.

  1. Doing it seperately makes it easy to debug.  
  2. Doing it seperately makes it easy to debug.  
  3. Doing it seperately makes it easy to debug.  
  4. It gets you thinking about how to use the compiler to answer
     machine-level questions, which is a lifetime kind of skill.

These will reduce the time you spend chasing thread bugs.  By alot.
If you make mistakes at this level in your threads package, dissecting
the cause of a crash and inverting it to the fix is much much harder
than tweaking a tiny, definitive, and isolated micro-test.

It will also make you better at actively figuring machine-level facts out:

  - The single biggest obstacle I've seen people make when writing
    assembly is that when they get stuck, they wind up staring passively
    at instructions for a long time, trying to discern what it does or
    why it is behaving "weird."

  - Instead of treating the code passively, be aggressive: your computer
    cannot fight back, and if you ask questions in the form of code
    it must answer.  When you get unsure of something, write small
    assembly routines to clarify.  For example, can't figure out why
    `LDMIA` isn't working?  Write a routine that uses it to store a
    single register.  Can't figure out if the stack grows up or down?
    take addresses of local variables in the callstack print them (or
    look in the `.list` files).

  - Being active will speed up things, and give you a way to
    ferret out the answer to corner case questions you have.

  - Both the [using gcc for asm](../../notes/using-gcc-for-asm/README.md)
    and [caller callee](../../notes/caller-callee.md) give some examples.

You should complete the five small programs in `code-asm-checks` that will
give you answers to the following questions you need for your threads:

  - `1-stack-dir.c`: Does the stack grow up or down?  You need to
     know this basic fact or you won't know whether to give the start
     of an allocated block as the stack or the end.

     Write the code in `1-stack-dir.c` to determine direction by 
     running it.

  - `2-where-push.c`: Your context-switching code will (probably)
    save registers using the `push` instruction, which pushes a list
    of general-purpose registers onto the stack.

    The question here: does `push` write to the stack before or after
    changing the stack pointer?  If you can't answer this question, you
    won't know the exact first address to initialize the stack pointer
    to.  A mistake will lead to hard-to-debug memory corruption bugs.

    NOTE: `push` implicitly uses the stack pointer `sp`.  so you'll have
    to (1) save the `sp` to a caller reg, (2) move the pointer argument
    to the `sp`, (3) do the `push`, (4) undo everything.

  - `3-push-order.c`: When you `push` multiple registers, what is the
    order they are written out? (Or, equivalently: where is each one
    placed?)

    Based on the architecture manual, the bulk register save and restore
    instructions store the smallest registers so that the
    smallest is at the lowest address.  (See: the armv6 document, or [ARM
    doc](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0473m/dom1359731152499.html)
    or [this](https://www.heyrick.co.uk/armwiki/STM)).

    The easist way to do this is to extend your `push_one` above to a 
    `push_two` and check the return result.

    Note: for `push` and `pop` don't include the stack pointer in the
    list of registers to `push` or `pop`!

  - `4-callee.c`: Finish the code so that when it runs
    it validates that the given registers are callee or callee saved.
    Search for `todo` --- you don't have to write much code, but the
    cool this will be when it runs that you will know *for sure* if
    you need to save a register or not.

    NOTE: you can also use this information to speed up your 
    interrupt handler trampolines from the previous lab: they 
    only need to save and restore the caller-saved registers (why
    the inverse?).

  - `5-write-regs.c`: how to write out the registers we need to save?
    (Needed for the save part of your context switch code.)
    How to know what memory offsets they got written to?  
    (Needed so your C code can initialize the thread stack.)

    For context switching we need to save (1) the callee-saved registers,
    (2) the return register, and finally, (3) write the stack pointer
    to a storage location (`saved_sp` in our thread block).

    Look in `5-write-regs.c` to see what we need to check this, and then
    implement `write_regs_to_stack` in `asm-checks.S`.  When you run
    the test, each printed register other than the stack pointer should
    match its expected value (the location for `r4` should hold `4` etc).

    This pattern of doing something in assembly, then calling C code
    to print the results and then exit (because our execution state is
    messed up) is a useful one to use throughout the lab.

Don't be afraid to go through the ARM manual (`docs/armv6.pdf`) or the
lectures we posted in `5-threads/docs`.

Now you have code that can mechanically validate the key low-level facts
you need, time to write the thread code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Now write threads in `code-threads`!

Before starting:
  - run `make checkoff` in `code-threads`.  It should pass.
  - Then change the `Makefile` to use your code:


```
        # switch these when implemented.
        # COMMON_SRC += rpi-thread-asm.S 
        STAFF_OBJS += $(S)/staff-rpi-thread-asm.o

        # switch these when implemented.
        # COMMON_SRC += rpi-thread.c
        STAFF_OBJS += $(S)/staff-rpi-thread.o
```

For the rest of the lab you'll only be modifying:
  - `rpi-thread.c`: the main thread code.
  - `rpi-thread-asm.S`: the assembly code you'll need (based on
    part 0).
  - If a test fails, you should probably do `make run` first so see if
    it panic'd.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 1: getting run-to-completion threads working (20 minutes)


We've tried to break down the lab into isolated pieces so you can test
each one.  The first is to get a general feel for the `rpi_thread`
interfaces by getting "run-to-completion" (RTC) threads working: these
execute to completion without blocking.

RTC threads are an important special case that cover a surprising number
of cases.  Since they don't block, you can run them as deferred function
calls.   They should be significantly faster than normal threads since:
  1. You don't need to context switch into them.
  2. You don't need to context switch out of them.
  3. You won't have to fight bugs from assembly coding.
Most interrupt handlers will fall into this category.

What to do:
  1. `rpi_fork` create a thread block, set the `fn` and `arg` field
     to the values passed into `rpi_fork` and put the thread on the 
     run queue.
  2. `rpi_thread_start` remove threads in FIFO order using `Q_pop`,
     and call each function and when it returns free the thread block.
     When there are no more threads, return back to the caller.
  3. Panic if code reaches `rpi_exit` (since we don't handle it).

  4. Make sure you keep the `trace` calls in the thread code: we use these
     for testing!

What you do not have to do:
  1. Write any assembly.
  2. Do anything with the thread stack.

Tests: `code-threads/1-*` 
  - set `PROGS` manually in the `Makefile`:

            PROGS = $(wildcard ./1-test*.c)
    and run:

            % make check


    Whichever method you do should pass.
  - `1-test-run-one.c`: run a single thread to completion.
  - `1-test-run-N.c`: run N threads to completion.

Note:
  - If a test fails, you can look at the associated reference
    files `.raw` (full output) and `.out` (reduced output) and compare
    them to the `.test` file generated by your code.

    For example, if `1-test-thread.bin` fails, `1-test-thread.test`
    contains the output from your code, and `1-test-thread.raw` the
    full reference output and `1-test-thread.out` just the reference
    trace statements.  You can also run `1-test-thread.bin` manually.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 2: building `rpi_fork` and `rpi_start_thread`

Test:
  - `2-test-one-fork.c`: There is a trivial program that
    forks a single thread, runs it, and then reboots.  I.e., you do not
    need to have `rpi_exit` working.  This makes it easier to debug if
    something is going on in your context switching.

Given your have done state saving both in the interrupt labs and in Part 1
above you should be able to implement `rpi_cswitch` without too much fuss:

  - Put your `cswitch` code into `rpi_cswitch` in `rpi-thread-asm.S`
    This will be based on your code
    `code-asm-checks/asm-checks.S:write_regs_to_stack` (from part 1),
    except that you will add the code to restore the registers as well.
    For today: only save the callee saved registers.  Since we are doing
    non-pre-emptive threads, the compiler will have saved any live caller
    registers when calling `rpi_yield`.

After context-switching, the main tricky thing left to figure out is how
to setup a newly created thread so that when you run context switching
on it, the right thing will happen (i.e., it will invoke to `code(arg)`).

  - The standard way to do this: during thread creation (`rpi_fork`)
    manually store values onto the thread's stack (sometimes called
    "brain-surgery") so that when the thread's state is loaded via
    `rpi_cswitch` control will jump to a trampoline routine (written in
    assembly) with `code` with `arg` in known registers.   The trampoline
    will then branch-and-link (using the `bl` instruction) to the `code`
    address with the value of `arg` in `r0` (note: you will have to
    move it there).
    
    As you'll see in part 3: The use of a trampoline lets us handle
    the problem of missing `rpi_exit` calls.

First, write `rpi_fork` :

  1. `rpi_fork` should write the address of trampoline
     `rpi_init_trampoline` to the `lr` offset in the newly
      created thread's stack (make sure you understand why!)  and the
      `code` and `arg` to some other register offsets (e.g., `r4` and
      `r5`) --- the exact offsets don't matter, it just matters
      that you know what registers the values will be loaded into
      later.

  2. Implement `rpi_init_trampoline` in `rpi-thread-asm.S` so that
     it loads arg` from the stack (from Step 1) into `r0`, 
     loads `code` into another register that it then uses to 
     do a branch and link.

  3. To handle missing `rpi_exit`: add a call to `rpi_exit` at the end
     of `rpi_init_trampoline`.

  4. To help debug problems: you can initially have the
     trampoline code you write (`rpi_init_trampoline`) initially just
     call out to C code to print out its values so you can sanity check
     that they make sense.

Second, write `rpi_start_thread`:

  - `rpi_start_thread` will context switch into the first thread it
    removes from the run queue.  Doing so will require creating a
    dummy thread (store it in the `scheduler_thread` global variable)
    so that when there are no more runnable threads, `rpi_cswitch` will
    transfer control back and we can return back to the main program.
    (If you run into problems, first try just rebooting when there are
    no runnable threads.)

What to do for `rpi_start_thread`:
  1. If the runqueue is empty, return.
  2. Otherwise: allocate a thread block, set the `scheduler_thread`
     pointer to it and contxt switch into the first runable thread.
  3. You contxt-switch out of the scheduler thread once and into it once
     when runque is empty.

What you *do not* do with the `scheduler_thread` thread:
 - Initialize its stack.
 - The scheduler thread is never on the runqueue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 3: implement `rpi_exit` 

Write `rpi_exit`: 
  - If it can dequeue a new runnable thread, context switch into it and
    free the old one.
  - If the run queue is empty: context switch into the
    initial start thread created by `rpi_start_thread` (stored in the
    `scheduler_thread` variable).

Tests:
  - `3-test-exit.c`: forks `N` threads that all explicitly call
    `rpi_exit`. 
  - `3-test-restart.c`: restarts the threads package over and over.

NOTE:
  - One confusing thing: if you run the `1-tests-run-*.c` tests now
    they will in a single line in the `.out` files:

        TRACE:rpi_exit:done running threads, back to scheduler

    Since you will have `rpi_exit` implemented.  This is ok.  Just make
    sure that's the only difference.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 4: implement `rpi_yield`

Write `rpi_yield`:
  - If the run-queue is empty: return.
  - Otherwise, pop and yield to the first thread on the run 
    queue after pushing the current thread.

Tests:
  - `3-test-yield.c`: forks `N` threads that all explicitly call
     `rpi_yield` and then call `rpi_exit`.

  - `3-test-yield-fail.c`: yields with an empty run queue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 5: Handle missing `rpi_exit` calls.

Note: If the thread code does not call `rpi_exit` explicitly but instead
returns, the value in the `lr` register that it jumps to will be nonsense.
Our hack: have our trampoline (from part 2) that calls the thread code
simply call `rpi_exit` if the intial call to `code` returns.


Tests:
   - `5-test-implicit-exit.c`: should run and print `SUCCESS`.
   - `5-test-implicit-exit-run-N.c`: this is the same program as part 1,
     but the behavior will now change with a single print from 
     `rpi_exit`. 
   - `5-test-implicit-exit-run-one.c`: same program as `1-test-run-one.c`
     but will now have a single print from `rpi_exit`.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 7: Running the larger programs.

Checking:
   - `7-test-thread.c` should work and print `SUCCESS`.
   - `7-test-ping-pong.c` should work and print `SUCCESS`.

If you want to get fancy, you should be able to run two LEDs in 
   - `7-test-yield.c`

Congratulations!  Now you have a simple, but working thread implementation
and understand the most tricky part of the code (context-switching)
at a level most CS people do not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
### Checkoff:
Run the autograder with 'lab5' as the repo variable. Make sure your github repo is updated and the sunet you input is correct

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Extensions: how fast can you make a loopback bit-bang protocol?

You can send and receive many protocols on a single pi by:
  1. Sender in one thread sends bits by using GPIO (and probably
     time) to bit-bang the protocol.  
  2. Receiver in one thread receives bits by reading the 
     GPIO pins (and probably time as well).

The trick:
  - When one thread is waiting for either a deadline or for data,
    `rpi_yield()` to run the other thread.  

The challenge:
  - The faster your code, and and the shorter the longest non-yielding
    delay, the more accurate you can make the code and the faster
    your bit banged protocol can blast bits.  It's not much code,
    but you can go for a couple of days tuning it.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Extensions: Sonar+LED

The full extension: build three different ways of mixing independent
threads of control for time sensitive devices.

Simple puzzle: use the sonar device to *smoothly* control an LED, where
the closer the reading, the brighter the led.  Challenge: no flickering,
smooth changes, and highly accurate ratios of on/off to hit a given
intensity.

Sounds trivial, and the code is trivially small, but it makes
some fundemental issues (and various solutions to them) very clear.
The problem: if you're not careful, the natural way to do sonar is with
blind waits where you spin in a delay loop, not doing anything else ---
the result is that your on/off gets inaccurate and the LED looks trash.

Three ways to do it:
  1. Interrupts: have the sonar in non-interrupt code, doing whatever
     logic it needs.  Then setup a timer interrupt and do the LED on/off
     in the interrupt handler.  Pretty simple to make work but gives
     a good reference.

  2. Variation: two threads, one for sonar, one for LED.  Sonar thread:
     change the sonar delay loop to call `rpi_yield()` on each iteration
     if its just waiting, otherwise do whatever it was supposed to
     do. LED thread: checks if enough time has passed and, if so, sets
     the LED to on/off (whichever is more accurate for the target ratio).
     It then yields.

     NOTE: the uart driver will also have to do the same yield.
     (The checked in code should do that.)

  3. Final option: make a stackless, "run to completion" thread
    package that uses continuations, and just have the sonar
    call into that.  

In all of these, being clean and clever with the checks that you never
miss a deadline can turn up the complexity.

Another way to go is to use a device to absorb the job of the LED on/off
so your code can focus on the sonar.  Many different options, 
all you will learn stuff:

  1. The PWM device (see bcm2835 datasheet).
  2. DMA (same)
  3. Using an SPI dataline (same).
  4. Using the SMI interface (if you can find the "unreleased
     datasheet!).
  5. Other methods?   I'm curious in all the different ways to 
     blink LEDs --- let us know if you think of a cute hack.

Very fun challenge.
