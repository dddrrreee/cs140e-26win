## PRELAB: look at `useful-examples`

In lab tomorrow we are going to write a trivial OS.
As part of that you'll need to understand some Unix system
calls (since we are going to build them).  Look at the
[useful-examples/README.md](useful-examples/README.md) and go through
the 5 programs in the Makefil understanding how `fork`, `waitpid`,
`exit` and `pipe` works.
